> This app allows the user to draw on the window. To allow for more space to draw, resize the window using the cursor.  
> Press the keyboard button <kbd>c</kbd> to clear all drawings.       
> To change to the next color, click down on the right mouse button once.   
> To draw, press on the left mouse button continuously.  

Curious how this was made? [`PaintApp.cpp`](/Paint-on-Chalk-Board-App/winproject/viewserver/PaintApp.cpp) contains detailed comments and links to references.
